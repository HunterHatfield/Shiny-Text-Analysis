# Shiny Text Analysis App

A Shiny application designed and developed by Hunter Hatfield and Emelia Hogg to perform no-code text mining and analysis. 

--- 

## Running the app

Run this Shiny application by downloading the app files, double-clicking on `ShinyTextApp.Rproj` and executing the function `runTextApp()`. 

### 1. Download or clone app files to your machine

Download and save the repository files to your machine through `Code > Download .zip`.

Alternatively, this repository can cloned into your R session using the repository URL: <https://github.com/HunterHatfield/Shiny-Text-Analysis>.

### 2. Launch `ShinyTextApp.Rproj`

Open the R project file `ShinyTextApp.Rproj`. This project and its associated `.Rprofile` will automatically call on all package dependencies for the app, R files, and run the `textApp()`.

### 3. Run the app with `runTextApp()`

Execute the command `runTextApp()` in the R console. This will launch the Shiny application on a local server.

To run the app, execute  the 'runTextApp()' function in the  console line just below this message.

Refresh the app by reloading your browser page or by hitting  the 'Reload' icon in the app's header.

Exit the app by clicking the 'Exit' icon in the app's header, or by clicking the small red 'Stop' button at the top right of the R console window.

## (Optional) Editing and manually lauching through R Studio

This app can be launched through in RStudio by calling on the `runTextApp()` function which is sourced in `R/app.R`. If any changes have been made, ensure all app files are sourced before the app is initialized again.
